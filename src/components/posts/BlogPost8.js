        How does the human mind perceive knowledge? Being human, we have our perception to connect us to the outer world. We see
        with our eyes, hear with our ears and smell with our nose. As we grow up we start to form opinions and learn to verbally
        communicate with one another. Our interests change over time, but curiosity never ceases. In the end, a lifelong
        of thinking, learning and answering questions leaves one with more questions than answers. It is the complex network
        within ourselves responsible for processing all that we perceive. An interconnected network of neurons that communicate
        internally, which requires no conscious thought. It is not this network that limits us, but it is our capabilities
        of processing all that we perceive. Our perception creates converged information formats, which we call thoughts.
        The human mind is incredibly effective in focusing its efforts, but as it specializes in one direction, it takes
        away from another.
        <br/>
        <br/> Science is ingrained within our society and it affects our personal living space. Its focus is to take in the whole
        picture in a systematic way on a specific subject. Science gathers large amounts of data, looks for connections and
        draws conclusions from them. Regardless of our best efforts to minimise error, we arguably are innately biased from
        the way that we perceive. Historically having evolved technically and intellectually requires us to constantly reassess
        our approach. The entire human learning curve has been a process of trial and error. A comprehensible next step in
        human evolution would be the integration of artificial intelligence within our society, to substitute our traits
        which we are innately not optimally competent at. A societal introspection is necessary for humanity to evolve.
        <br/>
        <br/> Иeureal offers an expansion of our minds. Although it is an artificial intelligence platform, it shows similar basic
        mechanisms with the human mind. It learns a lot like humans do, only faster, more effective and efficiently by using
        an algorithm in a hierarchical fashion. It uses a mining strategy with stackable architecture. These miners are those
        who run this algorithm or an altered version of it, and therefore they serve as predictors on multiple levels. It
        is as if multiple brains are interconnected with one another, seemingly communicating information automatically into
        a live data stream. Collecting data through Иeureal counters the problem of human perception bias.
        <br/>
        <br/> Perhaps Иeureal is the bridge that connects our neural network with those of others. It uses blockchain technology
        to make this computing power infinitely scalable and accessible by the entire world. Blockchain offers an interconnected
        network similar to our nervous system. It allows us to process all the data input globally, in which miners serve
        as its neurons. These miners continually exchange information, constantly learning and evolving. Traditionally processing
        this amount of information would require an enormous data center, significantly increasing risk for it is centralized.
        If a single neuron in our nervous system would for some reason perish, in the grand scheme of things nothing changes.
        Although if a centralized location where all the data is processed would fail, we would soon be flatlining. The limitations
        that human perception has are difficult to deal with. Nonetheless this is precisely what modern science attempts.
        It is through the compliance of scientific principles that researchers battle our innate biases. By using artificial
        intelligence, scientific compliance is optimized, error is reduced, and learning is accelerated. The blockchain eliminates
        logistical problems and greatly enhances the availability of data subjects, a problem often faced in research. It
        is through a stream of data that results no longer just reflect the past. Instead this stream of data gives a representation
        of the present, while potentially even predicting the future. Иeureal expands upon a global mind in a way the human
        mind on its own never could.
