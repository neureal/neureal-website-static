      <div className='title-blog'>How to Tell if Your AI + Blockchain Start Up is Doing It Right</div>
      <div className='caption-blog'>
        In a world where no AI + Blockchain company is fully developed, this headline might seem like a bold statement to make. That
        doesn’t mean we can’t examine the criteria for viable solutions to AI using blockchain and how companies should navigate
        this space.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>Start with Your Blockchain</div>
        <br/> An AI + Blockchain start up is, in many ways, like any other blockchain start up (which, in turn, is like any other
        start up). The market is flooded with ICOs grasping at contributor dollars for their platform. Those who have spent
        any time with these ICOs know that they are not created equal.
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>The Marketing Mistake</div>
        <br/> The advice for most ICOs is to review the whitepaper, team, website, and so on. The assumption here is that a well
        developed and presented project is safer because they have invested resources into developing their platform.
        <br/>
        <br/> The pendulum has swung the other way and flashy, well designed ICOs are abundant. But why is this the case? In many
        instances it’s because the marketing captures attention and fast funding from eager contributors.
        <br/>
        <br/> The dollars go toward marketing instead of development and growth. [The result is a situation that can have contributor
        funding sitting on a promise of something while the focus remains on more eyes.]
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>The Money First Mistake</div>
        <br/> Similar to the marketing mistake, these two go hand in hand with a problematic theme in the ICO space: lots of funding
        and little to show for it.
        <br/>
        <br/> Big players like Cardano, EOS, and even TRON have found themselves in the top 10 crypto assets with multi-billion
        dollar market caps and no product, simply due to the promise of their product and a few names associated with them.
        In some cases, names that inspire great confidence and promising track records. Are these names worth billions of
        dollars? Remember: no product.
        <br/>
        <br/> This isn’t to say these projects are doomed, but the aforementioned examples aren’t the only ones. The paradigm
        in the ICO space seems to involve a premise and a white paper followed by funding and hope. Few projects dare to
        develop their product and forego the sexy face lift for foundational engineering of effective decentralized solutions.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>Token Economics</div>
        <br/> Perhaps one of the trickiest aspects of understanding crypto assets for newcomers involves understanding token economics.
        This deals with creation and distribution of the token associated with a platform.
        <br/>
        <br/> Important factors include how many tokens will be available, tokens available for purchase, contribution restrictions,
        type of token, among others. These are important to understanding the network and how to participate in it. But the
        way in which they’re managed has implications.
        <br/>
        <br/> Decentralized platforms rely on widespread participation. Start ups that are in line with that vision look to build
        communities around their solutions that foster the growth of the community and start up together. Positive signs
        include structuring their ICO in a way that is as inclusive as possible. Limiting funding to few sources encourages
        the same problems centralized entities already face (and if that’s the case, why use blockchain at all?). Similar
        red flags pop up when start ups reserve the bulk of their tokens for themselves.
        <br/>
        <br/> It’s not good enough to just add blockchain. There are no shortage of companies looking to raise fast cash because
        they can add blockchain. These aren’t unlike businesses that made an employee open social media accounts because
        he heard he has to have his business on social media.
        <br/>
        <br/> Combined with the right outlook/roadmap, great blockchain start ups are built with the vision, development, and
        community aligned with Satoshi’s vision. The AI renaissance can benefit immensely from blockchain but only if done
        the right way. The way to see AI into the future is as a global community, not under lock and key of a few corporate
        entities.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>About the AI part... </div>
        <br/> Artificial intelligence isn’t just an engineering challenge, it’s also poses logistical problems. Those developing
        AI + Blockchain platforms
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>Knowledge of Blockchain</div>
        <br/> This isn’t as obvious as it might sound. The requirements of AI can impose certain challenges for blockchain. Already
        we’ve seen issues with network congestion in both bitcoin and Ethereum networks with transaction upon transaction
        in queue.
        <br/>
        <br/> That doesn’t work for a competitive marketplace especially if working with live data. Start ups looking to blend
        AI + blockchain need to understand the limitations of various blockchain protocols and issues facing existing protocols
        today.
        <br/>
        <br/> The same issues facing crypto assets today are issues that AI + blockchain will have to address tomorrow. Low throughput,
        slow and expensive transactions, and a host of scaling issues await on the other side of highly successful AI + blockchain
        start ups.
        <br/>
        <br/> AI + Blockchain teams not only require foundational understanding of blockchain but should have at least one blockchain
        expert on their team to merge these technologies effectively and avoid the trap of merely adding buzzwords to bolster
        business ideas. Evaluate the AI + blockchain platform for how they address the shortcomings of blockchain for a competitive
        AI marketplace.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>The Where and How of The Data</div>
        <br/> Data is the food that feeds AI. Without it, AI cannot be trained effectively. Predictive AI algorithms depend on
        good data in order to achieve the best predictions. Because of this, data ought to be both varied and open.
        <br/>
        <br/> Both static and live data feeds are invaluable depending on the design and goal of the AI platform. Since different
        entities may use an AI marketplace, that marketplace must be able to accommodate the necessary data. If we look at
        predictive AI, its predictions are limited by the data and how well it can predict that data. Access to, and the
        ability to handle, various data inputs is crucial to the platform’s effectiveness. How is the platform going to operate
        based on the type of data provided and how can it leverage that for the end user?
        <br/>
        <br/> Perhaps the biggest advantage of a decentralized AI marketplace is the diversity of data. Data from a single source
        is problematic and serves as one of the roadblocks of the current centralized AI paradigm. This can lead to biases
        in the data that are collected from a single source. AI + blockchain start ups need to understand the role for open
        participation in data sharing and processing.
        <br/>
        <br/> When it comes to that data, start ups must remember that there are no “walled gardens” in a decentralized marketplace.
        Innovators must exercise caution when designing their AI + blockchain platforms to handle that data. Fortunately
        the encrypted nature of blockchain technology can allow for safe use and processing of data without compromising
        the security of that data. AI + blockchain start ups need to clearly define how they handle this issue in a way that
        maintains the integrity of the network.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>Method of Application</div>
        <br/> What is the purpose of blending AI + blockchain? Is it to build a global recognition platform? To contribute to
        general AI? To predict specific events?
        <br/>
        <br/> Artificial intelligence is quickly suffering from buzzword symptoms. Many hear AI and think, “Machine that does
        it without humans.” There’s very little context. For AI + blockchain start ups, that simply won’t do. In many cases,
        it’s less about the AI specifically and more about the focus and execution of how it is integrated into the blockchain.
        <br/>
        <br/> AI + blockchain start ups need to be clearly defined. This can be difficult due to the nature of development. Many
        platforms are still being built as funding fuels that development. That means going back to the whitepaper and visiting
        the community to understand what the team is trying to achieve and how that fits into the current AI + blockchain
        ecosystem.
        <br/>
        <br/> Some contributors might be surprised to discover that certain AI + blockchain start ups are not mutually exclusive
        and can even compliment one another. To discover how you will have to do a little research into each of their projects.
        While doing so, make sure they have detailed the method of AI application, the aim of that AI, and how it integrates
        into a decentralized global community.
        <br/>
        <br/> When looking at AI + blockchain start ups, you should investigate the possible pitfalls inherent to all budding
        blockchain projects. This is a tech focused industry drowning in marketing material hyping one ICO after another.
        When the tide settles, those with strong fundamentals and solid community will remain. Communities like Neureal aim
        to deliver a focused product with the right vision and development to see through the noise. Better to build it so
        that they may come than to fund it and hope it works.
