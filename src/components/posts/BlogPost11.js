        After a recent conversation on LinkedIn spurred my curiosity, I went looking at how the current spike of ETH would look for
        the ICOs of 2017. The results shocked me.
        <br/>
        <br/> Five years. That’s a lifetime in blockchain.
        <br/>
        <br/> Look what we’ve seen in the last five MONTHS.
        <br/>
        <br/> Even from a hardware perspective, we’re already seeing the shortage of chips because of the drain that mining is
        putting on the industry. NVIDIA had to create new chips solely for the purpose of mining, and now they’ve released
        a new one customized for AI; if those can be used for mining they will be.
        <br/>
        <br/> And when the first mining operation ponies up the Bitcoin to buy a quantum computer the blockchain is going to have
        to adapt. And we’ll see another huge spike in the applications and productivity.
        <br/>
        <br/> Factor in the brainpower currently operating in the space, and the decentralized nature and the application of blockchain
        five years from now is going to exceed anything we could imagine today. Look what Vitalik did with a handful of coders;
        what Elon did with his team, Gates and his. Now, with the power of blockchain and open-source, you have entire teams
        of Elons + Vitaliks + Gates.
        <br/>
        <br/> Five years? Who knows.
        <br/>
        <br/> That’s what I love about this technology; it’s keeping us all on our toes, striving into a future that is shifting
        as quickly as we turn calendar pages.
