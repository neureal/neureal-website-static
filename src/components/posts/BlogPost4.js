      <div className='title-blog'>When Does Decentralization Make Sense?</div>
      <div className='caption-blog'>
        At the time of this article, there are over 1,400 crypto assets listed on coinmarketcap.com. Where once we barely heard bitcoin
        spoken outside the occasional news release, today you can hear people discussing Ethereum in the grocery store. Those
        who would never concern themselves with cryptocurrencies and fintech are arguing the merit of Ripple and asking what
        this Cardano thing is.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='caption-blog'>
          Digging through the rich world of crypto will inevitably lead to utility tokens. These are often businesses leveraging blockchain
          technology to disrupt an existing category in the market. And make no mistake, with this many crypto assets in
          existence, there’s bound to be one disrupting any industry you can think of. Whether it’s publishing, ride sharing,
          dozens of gaming application, energy, computing, virtual/augmented reality, insurance, advertising—you name it
          and there’s a blockchain for it.</div>
        <br/>
        <br/> But are all of these crypto assets necessary, or are we adding blockchain to business the way we added .com’s to
        them in the 90’s?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>We Already Love Pseudo-Decentralized Platforms</div>
        <br/> The internet has been decentralizing aspects of business since the world wide web began. From eliminating the need
        to go to the store with Amazon and eBay to not even needing your computer to store your data with cloud storage.
        This approach to distributing these ecosystems has continued to evolved in recent years.
        <br/>
        <br/> Uber and AirBNB are prime examples of our affinity for this model. With Uber, you no longer have to resort to individual
        taxi services. As long as Uber is allowed in your city, anybody who is authorized to be an Uber driver can offer
        you that service which is handled by Uber’s platform. Similarly, AirBNB means you don’t have to stay at the same
        hotels that limit your accommodation options.
        <br/>
        <br/> These platforms offer incentives for all users of the platform. Uber drivers are able to earn money while users
        have more convenience and flexible payment options that could suit them better. AirBNB creates more locations and
        rooming options to accommodate travellers. Reputation based systems allow users to be more confident in their rooming
        choices—often at better rates than they might find elsewhere
        <br/>
        <br/> This has opened up the marketplace in a way. It has lowered the barriers to entry and improved upon the user experience.
        Of course, these are still centralized companies, so we will have to dig deeper.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>Decentralizing, Blockchain, and the Token</div>
        <br/> The companies above do a good job of decentralizing their workforce but their platforms still depend on the trust
        of the central authority that secures the network. Blockchain and similar paradigms in the crypto-asset space can
        do this independent of a third party.
        <br/>
        <br/> Blockchain is the foundational technology of cryptocurrency. It is an open, immutable record of data that is committed
        to a distributed ledger by distinct members of the network. That means we don’t need a third party to verify when
        a transaction goes through (as in banks for currency) or an agreement is legitimate (contracts). We’ve created remarkably
        secure and reliable platforms with the blockchain. But before we rush to blockchain the world, we need to assess
        when it’s better than trusting a third party, and what advantages it offers.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog-underline'>1. Decentralizing, Blockchain, and the Token</div>
        <br/> Any system that requires trust in another party is susceptible to fraud. Globally, the average percentage loss due
        to fraud between 1997 and 2016 was 5.85% as a proportion of global GDP. [1] That equates to $4.39 trillion.
        <br/>
        <br/> And it’s increased 43% between study windows (1997-2007, 2014-2016).
        <br/>
        <br/> This can have a real effect on industries. Take affiliate marketing platforms that drive traffic to websites. Companies
        rely on these platforms to delivery quality prospects to their business. In turn they receive metrics from paid campaigns
        and trust the results to be fair and accurate. Roughly half of all website visitors are bots [2] while losses from
        fraud could account for over $16 billion USD in 2017.
        <br/>
        <br/> Decentralizing allows for an immutable record that can log transactions and agreements in a way that can’t be forged.
        Transparency is a necessity to participate in the network and offers users piece of mind for companies, users, and
        stakeholders alike.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog-underline'>2. Security (Redundancy)</div>
        <br/> Due to the distributed nature of the blockchain, the network remains secure. This is partly due to how special users
        commit data to the blockchain. These miners are many and anonymous and each contain a full copy of the ledger since
        its inception (known as running a full node). This means that if one is hacked, the network isn’t compromised because
        the integrity of the ledger is maintained by the other nodes in the network. It has its own sort of internal redundancy.
        <br/>
        <br/> Centralized systems do something similar. For instance, a data center will install multiple backup servers in case
        one fails. For critical information, a system shutdown is unacceptable and thus contingencies have to be build in.
        With blockchain, it’s intrinsic to the design of the network and does not need a third party to handle that data
        for you.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog-underline'>3. Open Access & Leveraging Populations</div>
        <br/> Decentralization often broadens participation. We have spread our communities beyond traditional borders and multinational
        ecosystems are built around these communities. Between the internet and gaming alone we have global reach to build
        and develop.
        <br/>
        <br/> In cases like bitcoin, this reach extends globally. It is open and allows anyone to take part. If you have an interesting
        project and want to promote an international community around your cause, you can leverage decentralization to allow
        more people to engage and contribute to your network. Thousands (or millions) of users can engage in projects they
        believe in.
        <br/>
        <br/> Imagine clinical trials contributed by teams of researchers in different countries that allow each team to glean
        critical insights instead of wasting time doing one trial after another in small research groups and having to compare
        those with every other research group. Imagine the open marketplace that could be created for the gaming community
        from development to downloadable content. Imagine being able to contribute data to millions of computers worldwide
        that can process and make predictions based on that data
        <br/>
        <br/> In 2007 Playstation participated in a Stratford study of human proteins to determine the role of protein folding
        in disorders like Alzheimer’s—a computationally expensive task. To circumvent this cost, Playstation 3 owners were
        able to contribute some of their processing power to the project. A single PS3 might not sound like a lot but taken
        together they can add up to a very significant contribution.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog-underline'>4. Inefficiency in Centralization</div>
        <br/> Sometimes centralization makes sense. Other times, it’s the hub of dated, inefficient protocols that cost time and
        money. The “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mentality stifles creativity and innovation. It keeps progress pigeonholed
        by the few who control that centralized authority.
        <br/>
        <br/> Decentralized platforms allow for faster innovation due to their open nature of contribution. They can open up the
        roadblocks between agents in new ways that get rid of headaches. We are already seeing this in healthcare applications
        that aim to ease the logistical nightmare of coordinating patient, insurer, and care provider. Here we have a system
        that requires excessive correspondence and follow ups to manage a patient’s care. Decentralized systems can allow
        open, encrypted communication between these three parties that can pre-qualify patients and fit them automatically
        to physicians according to insurance coverage, patient condition, physician specialization, and availability. These
        things don’t have to be the headache they are with effective application of a decentralized system.
        <br/>
        <br/> Decentralization is nothing new, but the new world of crypto assets and blockchain have given it a new spin with
        revolutionary ways of approaching our favorite industries. Blockchain business models align incentives through tokens.
        Whereas once, a shareholder, business, and customer would be competing for best interests, tokens align incentives.
        These new ecosystems allow for opportunity to disrupt and improve existing sectors while innovating for future markets.
