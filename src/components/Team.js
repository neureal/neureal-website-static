With over two decades of experience building and maintaining entrepreneurial organisms, from startups to established partnerships in numerous industries, her involvement at the onset of new development has repeatedly generated millions to bottom line. For the last decade, she specialized in intellectual property, working intimately with both NYT bestselling clients as well as smaller first-time movers into the publishing space to create, systematize, and deploy new income streams. Clients include New York Times and USA Today bestselling thriller, mystery, and fantasy writers, as well as international speakers, business coaches, and serial entre- preneurs. Her chaos management strategies identify and implement systems to enable the structures to exist beyond her involvement, ensuring their continued success is not based on singular individuals, but as a whole. Systems are everything. Strategic decisions are everything else. Nothing works without community'}

The architecture for Neureal exists as a whole inside his head and it is through the coming phases of Neureal’s road map-- with the help, guidance, and stewardship of other members of the core team--that we, as a community, will be able to begin using what he’s already envisioned.'}
